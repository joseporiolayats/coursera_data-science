### Exploratory Data Analysis

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site

There has to be some graphs exploring the data.

Everything is explained into each R script for each plot, or alternatively I've made a run_all.R script to generate all plots.
